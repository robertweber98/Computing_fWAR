## An attempt to compute fWAR of fangraphs.com for position players
The following contains a step-by-step attempt to compute fangraphs.com's WAR for position players. I was able to manually calculate all pieces of the metric that use public data.

UBR (Ultimate Baserunning) and UZR (Ultimate Zone Rating) use the private UZR data set so I was not able to achieve a manual calculation for the listed metrics and any pieces that utilize said metrics. I do, however, have an attempt posted for UBR, which all are welcome to review and find my mistakes. I say that because I achieved numbers for UBR using the statcast data, but they do not match those of fangraphs.
