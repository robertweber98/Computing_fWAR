# Data
The in-file data-set names are as follows: "wp.df" is the full (with pitchers) fangraphs.com batting data set, "sc.data" is the 2017 statcast data, "team_stats" is the 2017 team data, "id" is the mlb id data set, and "defense" is the fangraphs.com data set with the fielding data.

# Cleaning
Some cleaing is necessary before the process begins. First, we need the positions of all the players in the data set because fangraphs.com doesn't let positions be in a dataset with offensive stats for some reason. That is what the "defense" data is used for. Then, since this is WAR for position players, fangraphs.com eliminates any pitchers from the data set in their calculations, but I keep the other data set just in case. Lastly, some of the names don't match up with the names in the data set being used to match names to their respective player i.d.s in the statcast data set. 
```{r Cleaning}
# first, this narrows down "defense" to just the player name, team, position, and innings played at said position (it is needed for the positional adjustment later)
defense[ , c("Name", "Team", "Position", "Inn")] -> defense 
# this next step switches the team abbreviations in "defense" to the team names like in "wp.df"
